            <p>Sometimes we want to redirect to a different view, if certain validations are not in place, or certain permissions are missing.</p>

            <p>When <span class="met">enter</span>ing a route, it is possible to navigate to a different route through,
                <span class="var">journey.goto('/somePath')</span>. When navigating to a another route during the <span class="fun">enter</span> phase of 
				phase of a route, Journey will cancel the <em>current</em> route, and continue to the <em>new</em> route.
            </p>

            <p>For example:</p>

            <div class="content">     
                <pre><code  class="line-numbers language-js">enter: function ( route, prevRoute, options ) {
				
		if ( route.query.typeId == null ) {

			// if typeId is missing from query parameters, route users to the '/invalid' page.
			// It we don't want the URL to change to '/invalid', we can pass the 'invisible' property to goto()
			// Navigating to a new route during the enter phase of another route, would cause Journey to emit
			// 'routeAbuseStart' event because it detects the user is changing routes too quickly. However in this
			// case the user is not abusing routes, she is simply redirecting. By passing the property 'redirect'
			// Journey is notified this is a redirect and should not raise the 'routeAbuseStart' event.
			journey.goto( "/invalid", {redirect: true, invisible: true} );

		} else {

			route.view = new Ractive( {
				el: options.target,
				template: template
			} );
